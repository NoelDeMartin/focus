# Focus

Focus is a Task Manager built to be used with the [Kinko](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/kinko) data storage.

⚠️ This project is a *work in progress*, and it has been paused to focus on developing applications using the [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu) protocol instead. You can find a Solid-compatible version of this app here: [https://github.com/noeldemartin/solid-focus](https://github.com/noeldemartin/solid-focus)
